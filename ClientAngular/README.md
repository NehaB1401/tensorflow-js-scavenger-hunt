# Tensorflow JS Scavenger Hunt

Scavenger Hunt is an experimental web based game that makes use of TensorFlow.js to identify objects seen by your webcam or mobile camera in the browser. We ask you to find some specific objects in the real world.

## mLab server

mLab is a fully managed cloud database service that hosts MongoDB databases. 
Database 'scvengerdb' is hosted by mLab running on Amazon Web Services.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
